### Apache SINGA: Levelling the playing field

**Abstract**:
Apache SINGA is a general distributed deep learning platform for training big deep
learning models over large datasets. It is designed with an intuitive
programming model based on the layer abstraction. A variety of popular deep
learning models are supported, namely feed-forward models including
convolutional neural networks (CNN), energy models like restricted Boltzmann
machine (RBM), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Many built-in layers are
provided for users. SINGA architecture is sufficiently flexible to run
synchronous, asynchronous and hybrid training frameworks. SINGA also supports
different neural net partitioning schemes to parallelize the training of large
models, namely partitioning on batch dimension, feature dimension or hybrid
partitioning. We will introduce the design and implementation of the system in
this talk. Sample applications will also be demonstrated to help audiences
get started with Apache SINGA.


**Biography**:
Dr. Chonho Lee works as a research fellow at School of Computing, NUS. He received
his Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts, Boston. He has
investigated self-adaptation mechanisms in distributed systems such as data
centers and sensor networks based on his expertise in multi-objectives
optimization, evolutionary computing, game theory and auction theory. His
current research interests include big data analytics in health-care area. He has
been working on analysis of visually-guided motor performance of Parkinson's
disease patients to help doctors diagnose the amount and time of L-dopa dosage.
He recently joins a SINGA team and tries to design predictive analytics model
for particular disease.

Wei Wang is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, NUS. His research
interests include distributed training of deep learning models, multi-modal data analysis.
Currently, he is a committer of Apache SINGA project.

### Petuum: A New Platform for Distributed Machine Learning on Big Data

**Abstract**:
What is a systematic way to efficiently apply a wide spectrum of advanced ML
programs to industrial scale problems, using Big Models (up to 100s of billions
of parameters) on Big Data (up to terabytes or petabytes)? Modern
parallelization strategies employ fine-grained operations and scheduling beyond
the classic bulk-synchronous processing paradigm popularized by MapReduce, or
even specialized graph-based execution that relies on graph representations of
ML programs. The variety of approaches tends to pull systems and algorithms
design in different directions, and it remains difficult to find a universal
platform applicable to a wide range of ML programs at scale. We propose a
general-purpose framework, Petuum, that systematically addresses data- and
model-parallel challenges in large-scale ML, by observing that many ML programs
are fundamentally optimization-centric and admit error-tolerant,
iterative-convergent algorithmic solutions. This presents unique opportunities
for an integrative system design, such as bounded-error network synchronization
and dynamic scheduling based on ML program structure. We demonstrate the
efficacy of these system designs versus well-known implementations of modern
ML algorithms, showing that Petuum allows ML programs to run in much less
time and at considerably larger model sizes, even on modestly-sized compute
clusters.

**Biography**:
Dr. Qirong Ho is a scientist at the Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR,
Singapore, and an adjunct assistant professor at the Singapore Management
University School of Information Systems. His primary research focus is
distributed cluster software systems for Machine Learning at Big Data scales,
with a view towards correctness and performance guarantees. In addition, Dr. Ho
has performed research on statistical models for large-scale network analysis
--- particularly latent space models for visualization, community detection,
user personalization and interest prediction --- as well as social media
analysis on hyperlinked documents with text and network data. Dr. Ho received
his PhD in 2014, under Eric P. Xing at Carnegie Mellon University's Machine
Learning Department. He is a recipient of the Singapore A*STAR National Science
Search Undergraduate and PhD fellowships, and is a recipient of the SIGKDD 2015
Doctoral Dissertation Award.



### Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction
**Abstract**:
It has been shown that news events influ- ence the trends of stock price
movements. However, previous work on news-driven stock market prediction
rely on shallow features (such as bags-of-words, named entities and noun
phrases), which do not capture structured entity-relation informa- tion,
and hence cannot represent complete and exact events. Recent advances in
Open Information Extraction (Open IE) techniques enable the extraction of
struc- tured events from web-scale data. We propose to adapt Open IE
technology for event-based stock price movement pre- diction, extracting
structured events from large-scale public news without manual efforts.
Both linear and nonlinear mod- els are employed to empirically investigate
the hidden and complex relationships be- tween events and the stock
market. Large- scale experiments show that our event-based system out-
performs bags-of-words-based baselines, and previously reported systems
trained on S&P 500 stock historical data. We further use deep learning to
improve the representation of event for enhanced generalization, and to
capture the influence of long-term and short-term historical events
simultaneously. These techniques boost the accuracy of index prediction
from 60% to 66%, and significantly enhance the accuracy of individual
stock prediction.

Yue Zhang is currently an assistant professor at Singapore University of
Technology and Design. Before joining SUTD in July 2012, he worked as a
postdoctoral research associate in University of Cambridge, UK. Yue Zhang
received his DPhil and MSc degrees from University of Oxford, UK, and his
BEng degree from Tsinghua University, China. His research interests
include natural language processing, machine learning and artificial
Intelligence. He has been working on statistical parsing, parsing, text
synthesis, machine translation, sentiment analysis and stock market
analysis intensively. Yue Zhang serves as the reviewer for top journals
such as Computational Linguistics, Transaction of Association of
Computational Linguistics and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.
He is also PC member for conferences such as ACL, COLING, EMNLP, NAACL,
EACL, AAAI and IJCAI. Recently, he was the area chairs of CLING 2014,
NAACL 2015 and EMNLP 2015.


###  Increasing the capacity of deep neural networks by learning spatial dependency and fine-grained features

**Abstract**:
Deep neural networks have achieved great success on many vision tasks. Compared
to traditional shallow learning methods, deep neural networks have higher
capacity to represent more complicated visual patterns in images. Currently,
researchers increase the representation capacity to fit a large amount of
training data by adding more convolution layers and pooling layers. In this
talk, I am going to introduce two alternative methods: one is to learn spatial
dependency between image regions using a DAG-RNN network; the other one learns
fined-grained CNN networks to represent discriminative features between subsets
of categories. Both methods can produce richer and deeper neural networks to
extract more informative features from images. Experiments on benchmark
datasets have proven the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and was a research
