To submit a training job, users need to convert raw data (e.g., images, text
documents) into records that can be recognized by SINGA. SINGA uses data layers
to load these records into memory and uses parser layers to parse features (e.g.,
image pixels and labels) from these records. The records could be organized and
stored using many different ways, e.g., a file, a light database, or HDFS, as
long as there is a corresponding [DataLayer]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1DataLayer.html) that can load the records.

## DataShard

SINGA comes with a light database named [DataShard]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1DataShard.html).
It provides operations for inserting [Record]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1Record.html),
and read `Record` in sequential order.
`Record`s are flushed once the maximum cache size is reached. It
loads `Record`s in batch and returns them to users one by one through the
[Next]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1DataShard.html) function.
The disk file (folder) is called a (data) shard. The
[ShardDataLayer]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1ShardDataLayer.html) is a built-in
layer for loading `Record`s from `DataShard`.

To create data shards for users' own data, they can follow the subsequent steps.

###  User record definition

Users define their own record for storing their data. E.g., the built-in
[SingleLabelImageRecord]({{ BASE_PATH }}/api/classsinga_1_1SingleLabelImageRecord.html)
has an int field for image label, and a pixel array for image RGB values.
The code below shows an example of defining a new record `UserRecord`, and extending the
base `Record` to include `UserRecord`.


    package singa;

    import "common.proto";  // required to import common.proto

    message UserRecord {
        repeated int userVAR1 = 1;    // unique field id
        optional string userVAR2 = 2; // unique field id
        ...
    }

    extend Record {
        optional UserRecord user_record = 101;  // unique extension field id, reserved for users (e.g., 101-200)
    }

Please refer to the
[Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp-generated?hl=en#extension)
for extension of protocol messages.

The extended `Record` will be parsed by a parser layer to extract features
(e.g., label or pixel values). Users need to write
their own [parser layers]({{ BASE_PATH }}/docs/layer#parser-layers) to parse the
extended `Record`.

*Note*

There is an alternative way to define the proto extension.
In this way, you should be careful of the scope of fields and how to access the
fields, which are different from the above.

    message UserRecord {
        extend Record {
            optional UserRecord user_record = 101;  // unique extension field id, reserved for users (e.g., 101-200)
        }
        repeated int userVAR1 = 1; // unique field id
        optional string userVAR2 = 2; // unique field id
        ...
    }
{% endcomment %}


###  DataShard creation

Users write code to convert their data into `Record`s and insert them into shards.

1. Create a folder *USER_DATA* under *SINGA_ROOT*.

2. Prepare the source file, e.g., `create_shard.cc`,  in `SINGA_ROOT/USER_DATA`

        singa::DataShard myShard(outputpath, kCreate);
        // outputpath is the path of the folder for storing the shard

    the above code opens a folder for storing the data shard.

        singa::Record record;
        singa::UserRecord* r = record.MutableExtension(singa::user_record);

    an user-defined record is allocated by the above code.

        r->add_userVAR1( int_val );     // for repeated field
        r->set_userVAR2( string_val );

    users load raw data and set/add them into user-defined record as shown above.

        // `String key`, will be a unique id for this message
        myShard.Insert( key, record );

    Once the `record` object is filled, it is inserted into the shard as shown above.
    If there are multiple data records, they should be inserted sequentially.
    After inserting all records, the shard is created into the `outputpath` folder.

3. Compile and link. Both *user.proto* and *create.cc* should be compiled and linked with libsinga.so.
  The following instruction generates *user.pb.cc* and *user.pb.h* from *user.proto*.

        protoc -I=SINGA_ROOT/USER_DATA --cpp_out=SINGA_ROOT/USER_DATA user.proto

    All code can be compiled and linked into an executable file

        g++ create_shard.cc user.pb.cc -std=c++11 -lsinga \
          -ISINGA_ROOT/include -LSINGA_ROOT/.libs/ -Wl,-unresolved-symbols=ignore-in-shared-libs \
          -Wl,-rpath=SINGA_ROOT/.libs/  -o create_shard.bin


4. Run the program. Once the executable file is generated, users can run it to create data shards.

        ./create_shard.bin  <args>


### Example - CIFAR dataset

This example uses CIFAR-10 image dataset collected by [Alex Krizhevsky](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
Each image has a label (stored as a number from 0 to 9). This dataset is stored in binary files with specific format.
SINGA has written the [create_shard.cc](https://github.com/apache/incubator-singa/blob/master/examples/cifar10/create_shard.cc)
to convert images in the binary files into `SingleLabelImageRecord`s and insert them into training and test shards.

  1 Download raw data. The following command will download the dataset into *cifar-10-batches-bin* folder.

        $ cp Makefile.example Makefile   // an example makefile is provided
        $ make download

  2 `SingleLabelImageRecord` is a built-in class provided by SINGA for storing
  an image with a single label, e.g., the images in CIFAR10. It is defined as follows,

          # common.proto
          package singa;

          message Record {
            enum Type {
              kSingleLabelImage = 0;
            }
            optional Type type = 1 [default = kSingleLabelImage];
            optional SingleLabelImageRecord image = 2;   // for configuration
          }

          message SingleLabelImageRecord {
            repeated int32 shape = 1;                // it obtains 3 (rgb channels), 32 (row), 32 (col)
            optional int32 label = 2;                // label
            optional bytes pixel = 3;                // pixels
            repeated float data = 4 [packed = true]; // it is used for normalization
          }

  3 Add/Set data into the record, and insert it to shard.
    `create_shard.cc` will read images (and labels) from the downloaded binary files.
    For each image, it puts the image feature and label into a `SingleLabelImageRecord`
    of `Record`, and then inserts the `Record` into `DataShard`.

          ...// open binary files
          // for training data
          DataShard train_shard("cifar10_train_datashard", DataShard::kCreate);

          singa::Record record;
          singa::SingleLabelImageRecord* image = record.mutable_image();;
          image->add_shape(3);
          image->add_shape(32);
          image->add_shape(32);
          for (int fileid = 0; fileid < kCIFARTrainBatches; ++fileid) {
            for (int itemid = 0; itemid < kCIFARBatchSize; ++itemid) {
              read_image(&data_file, &label, str_buffer);  // read feature and label from binary file
              image->set_label(label);
              image->set_pixel(str_buffer, kCIFARImageNBytes);
              int length = snprintf(str_buffer, kCIFARImageNBytes, "%05d", fileid * kCIFARBatchSize + itemid);
              train_shard.Insert(string(str_buffer, length), record);    // write a record to shard with unique ID
            }
          }

    Data shard for testing data is created similarly.
    In addition, it computes average values of image pixels as another `Record`
    which is directly serialized into *SINGA_ROOT/USER_DATA/image_mean.bin*,
    The mean values will be used for preprocessing image features

          for (int itemid = 0; itemid < kCIFARBatchSize; ++itemid) {
            const string& pixels = image->pixel();
            for(int i=0; i<kCIFARImageNBytes; i++)
              mean.set_data(i, mean.data(i)+static_cast<uint8_t>(pixels[i]));
            count += 1;
          }
          for(int i=0; i<kCIFARImageNBytes; i++)
            mean.set_data(i, mean.data(i)/count);
          WriteProtoToBinaryFile(mean, (output_folder+"/image_mean.bin").c_str());

  4 Compile and run the program. SINGA provides an example Makefile that contains instructions
    for compiling the source code and linking it with *libsinga.so*. Users just execute the following command.

        $ cp Makefile.example Makefile
        $ make create

    The data shards for training and testing will be generated into
    *cifar10_train_shard* and *cifar10_test_shard* folders respectively.

### Example - MNIST dataset

This example creates `DataShard`s for the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
It has a training set of 60,000 handwritten digit images, and a test set of 10,000 images.
Similar to the images of CIFAR10, each MNIST image has a single label. Hence, we still
use the built-in `SingleLabelImageRecord`. The process is almost the same as that for
the CIFAR10 dataset, except that the MNIST dataset is downloaded as binary files with
different format. SINGA has written the *create_shard.cc* program to parse the binary files
and convert MNIST images into `SingleLabelImageRecord`s.

The following command will download the dataset

    $ cp Makefile.example Makefile   // an example makefile is provided
    $ make download

Data shards will be generated into *mnist_train_shard* and *mnist_test_shard* by

    $ make create
