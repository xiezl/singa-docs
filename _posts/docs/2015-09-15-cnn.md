This example will show you how to use SINGA to train a CNN model using cifar10 dataset.

### Prepare for the data
* First go to the `example/cifar10/` folder for preparing the dataset. There should be a makefile example called Makefile.example in the folder. Run the command `cp Makefile.example Makefile` to generate the makefile.
Then run the command `make download` and `make create`  in the current folder to download cifar10 dataset and prepare for the training and testing datashard.

### Set job configuration.
* If you just want to use the training model provided in this example, you can just use job.conf file in current directory. Fig. 1 gives an example of CNN struture. In this example, we define a CNN model that contains 3 convolution+relu+maxpooling+normalization layers.
If you want to learn more about how it is configured, you can go to [Model Configuration](http://singa.incubator.apache.org/docs/model-config.html) to get details.

### Run SINGA
All script of SINGA should be run in the root folder of SINGA.
First you need to start the zookeeper service if zookeeper is not started. The command is `./bin/zk-service start`.
Then you can run the command

    ./bin/singa-run.sh -conf examples/cifar10/job.conf

to start a SINGA job using examples/cifar10/job.conf as the job configuration.
After it is started, you should get a screenshots like the following:


    xxx@yyy:zzz/incubator-singa$ ./bin/singa-run.sh -conf examples/cifar10/job.conf
    Unique JOB_ID is 2
    Record job information to /tmp/singa-log/job-info/job-2-20150817-055601
    Executing : ./singa -conf /xxx/incubator-singa/examples/cifar10/job.conf -singa_conf /xxx/incubator-singa/conf/singa.conf -singa_job 2

After the training of some steps (depends on the setting) or the job is finished, SINGA will checkpoint the current parameter. In the next time, you can train (or use for your application) by loading the checkpoint. Please refer to [Checkpoint](http://singa.incubator.apache.org/docs/checkpoint.html) for the use of checkpoint.
